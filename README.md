Tempore (as in *in tempore*, Latin for "in good time") is a prototype
programming language that combines graded modal types with graded effect systems
to specify and verify temporal properties of resources that programs manipulate.
The properties are checked automatically by Hindley–Milner style type inference.

Tempore is a further development of Temporal Millet, which was implemented in
[Joosep Tavits](https://github.com/joosepgit)'s Master's thesis at the
University of Tartu ([code](https://github.com/joosepgit/temporal-millet),
[thesis](https://thesis.cs.ut.ee/1c038012-af0d-444a-95dc-7ffc8b3a1f20)). It adds
(i) temporal algebraic effects and effect handlers that are guaranteed to
respect the temporal specifications of operations, and (ii) general resource
grades in place of natural-number time grades, which only modelled left-sided
time intervals expressing lower time bounds of programs.

Tempore (and Temporal Millet that preceded it) is built on Matija Pretnar's
[Millet Language](https://github.com/matijapretnar/millet) and follows the
ideas of [Ahman](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-30829-1_1) and [Ahman and
Žajdela](https://msfp-workshop.github.io/msfp2024/submissions/ahman+%c5%beajdela.pdf).

## Installing and running

Tested to work with OCaml >= 5.0. Install the dependencies and build:

    opam install --deps-only --with-dev-setup .
    make

`make test` runs the test suite, and `make clean` removes the build.

There are two ways to run programs:

- **Web interface**, at `web/index.html` after building, or online at
  <https://danel.ahman.ee/tempore-lang/>. Load a built-in example or type a
  program, check whether the example typechecks, and if it does, step through
  its reductions one by one while watching the resource state evolve.

- **Command line**:

      ./tempore file1.tpe file2.tpe ...

  loads all listed files and runs every `run` command, printing each run's
  result and final resource state.

  Options: `--resources <monoid>` selects the grading monoid (see below),
  `--typecheck-only` typechecks the files without running them, `--no-stdlib`
  skips the standard library, and `--debug` also prints the typing context.

The [`examples/`](examples/) directory contains the programs available in the
web interface; each also starts with listing the command that runs it in CLI.

## Grading monoids

Resource usage is measured in a grading monoid (an ordered monoid with some
additional structure). The monoid is not part of a source file but chosen when
the program is run: with `--resources` on the command line, e.g.

    ./tempore --resources time-interval examples/time_intervals.tpe

or with the **Resource grade** selector in the web interface, which switches
its value automatically when a built-in example is loaded. The default grade
monoid is `time-lower-bound`. Currently, six monoids are available to choose.

Three monoids grade resources and computations by time, written as integer
literals such as `3` or pairs such as `(1, 4)`:

- **`time-lower-bound`** — non-negative integers, a lower bound on the time a
  computation takes. `rho` is a sub-grade of `rho'` when `rho >= rho'`; zero is
  the *top* of the order.
- **`time-upper-bound`** — non-negative integers, an upper bound on the time a
  computation takes. `rho` is a sub-grade of `rho'` when `rho <= rho'`; zero is
  the *minimum* of the order.
- **`time-interval`** — pairs `(n, m)` with `n <= m`, a lower and an upper
  bound at once. `(n, m)` is a sub-grade of `(k, l)` when `n >= k` and
  `l >= m` (interval containment); `(0, 0)` is the minimum. See
  [`examples/time_intervals.tpe`](examples/time_intervals.tpe).

All three variants of time bounds are inclusive on the values they carry, e.g.,
while intervals are written as `(n,m)`, they should be read as `[n,m]`.

Three monoids grade resources and computations by the *timed traces* they may
exhibit. A timed trace is one run of a computation, an alternation of operation
events and positive delays: `Read; 3; Send` performs `Read`, waits three ticks,
and performs `Send`. A grade built from traces is a non-empty finite set of
runs, the alternatives a computation may exhibit, `{Read; 3; Send | Send;
Send}`; grades multiply by the (non-commutative) language product. An integer
`n` abbreviates `{n}`, so the zero grade is `{0}`. The orders trade time against
operations through the runtime bounds `within (lo, hi)` every atomic operation
(one whose trace is its own name) declares under these monoids (see below).

- **`traces-lower-bound`** — the runs a computation must *cover*. `rho`
  is a sub-grade of `rho'` when every run of `rho` covers some run of `rho'`:
  each operation performed banks its `lo` towards the delays `rho'` demands,
  but waiting never counts as performing a demanded operation. `{0}` is the
  top of the order. See
  [`examples/traces_lower.tpe`](examples/traces_lower.tpe).
- **`traces-upper-bound`** — the runs a computation is *allowed*. `rho`
  is a sub-grade of `rho'` when every run of `rho` fits inside some run of
  `rho'`: a delay in `rho'` pays for operations of `rho` at their `hi`, but
  waiting never counts as performing an operation the bound asks for. `{0}` is
  the minimum of the order. See
  [`examples/traces_upper.tpe`](examples/traces_upper.tpe).
- **`traces-interval`** — pairs `({...}, {...})` of a lower bound
  (coverage order, reading `lo`) and an upper bound (allowance order, reading
  `hi`), compared componentwise. `{...}` abbreviates the pair of a set with
  itself, `n` abbreviates `({n}, {n})`, and `(n, m)` abbreviates
  `({n}, {m})`. `({0}, {0})` is neither the top nor the minimum. See
  [`examples/traces_intervals.tpe`](examples/traces_intervals.tpe).

## Temporal resources

A value of the modal type `[rho]a` is an `a`-typed resource that may be used
only once the grade `rho` has been accumulated since it was created: an amount
of time, a sequence of operations, or whatever the chosen monoid measures.

- `box rho e` creates a resource of type `[rho]a`. The expression `e` is typed
  in the hypothetical future in which the accumulated grade has grown by `rho`.
- `unbox e` opens a resource `e : [rho]a`, yielding an `a`. It is allowed only
  if the grade accumulated since `e` was boxed is a sub-grade of `rho`: at
  least `rho` ticks under the lower-bound monoids, at most `rho` under the
  upper-bound ones, and a run that covers or fits inside `rho` under the trace
  monoids.
- `delay tau` advances the accumulated grade by `tau`. Operation calls (below)
  advance it by the grade of the operation.

See [`examples/delay.tpe`](examples/delay.tpe).

The computation type of a function can be stated explicitly, either on its body,
`let f () : mounted # rho = ...`, or on the function as a whole, `let f : unit
-> mounted # rho = fun () -> ...`. The annotation is a sub-effecting coercion,
analogously to handlers' operation case: the grade the body accumulates must be
a sub-grade of the one stated in the type annotation.

## Eternal types

A type is *eternal* if its values stay valid however much grade accumulates
after they are bound. Eternal are the base types (integers, strings, booleans,
floats, unit), tuples of eternal types, and algebraic types all of whose
constructor arguments are eternal. Function types, handler types, and box types
`[rho]a` are never eternal. A type variable is eternal exactly when it is
instantiated with an eternal type, so a parameterised type is eternal depending
on how its parameters are used: `'a list` is eternal when `'a` is, while a
phantom parameter, as in `type 'a tag = Tag`, imposes nothing.

Referencing a local variable `x : a` generates the constraint "`a` is eternal,
or the grade accumulated since `x` was bound is a sub-grade of zero". Under
`time-lower-bound` and `traces-lower-bound` zero is the top of the order,
so the constraint always holds and any local variable may be used at any later
point. Under the other monoids a local variable of a non-eternal type must be
used before any `delay` or operation call has happened since it was bound.

When the constraint depends on a type variable of a top-level definition, it
is not decided at the definition but becomes a qualifier of its generalised
type, checked at every use. For example, under `time-upper-bound`,

```
let keep x = delay 1; x
let after g x = g (); x
```

respectively get the types `{eternal α} α → α # 1` and
`{eternal α ∨ ρ <= 0} (unit → β # ρ) → α → α # ρ`, shown by `--debug`. So
`keep 5` is accepted, `keep (fun () -> ())` is rejected, and
`after (fun () -> delay 2) 5` is accepted because `5` is eternal, while
`after (fun () -> ()) (fun () -> ())` is accepted because the grade of `g` is
zero. Only a constraint on a variable of the definition's type is kept: an
operation case runs at a time the handler does not fix, so a local variable
captured anywhere in a case must be eternal outright, and a variable occurring
in no exported type is instantiated as the constraint needs. See
[`examples/eternal_types.tpe`](examples/eternal_types.tpe) and the end of
[`examples/3dprint_traces.tpe`](examples/3dprint_traces.tpe).

A type definition can be declared non-eternal regardless of its structure:

```
noneternal type epoxy = Epoxy
```

This makes `epoxy`, and every type containing it, non-eternal. The keyword
prefixes a whole `type ... and ...` group. It is allowed on algebraic types
only, since type aliases are unfolded before eternality is checked.

## Algebraic effects and effect handlers

Operations are declared at the top of a source file:

```
operation OperationName : input-type ~> result-type # grade
```

The grade records the resource usage of one call.

Under the timed-trace monoids an *atomic* operation, one graded by the singleton
trace set containing just itself, must also state its runtime bounds,

```
operation OperationName : input-type ~> result-type # grade within (lo, hi)
```

the least and greatest number of ticks a call may take (`within n` is short for
`within (n, n)`). The bounds are the cost model of the trace orders:
`traces-lower-bound` reads `lo`, `traces-upper-bound` reads `hi`,
and `traces-interval` reads both.

A *compound* operation names other, already declared operations in its grade,
and its bounds are computed from theirs: `lo` is the duration of the fastest run
of its grade with every event at its lower bound, `hi` that of the slowest run
with every event at its upper bound. So given `Tx : string ~> unit # {Tx} within
(2, 3)`, the operation `Send : string ~> unit # {Tx | Tx; Tx}` gets the bounds
`(2, 6)`; declaring bounds on it is rejected, as is naming itself, since `Send #
{Send | Send; Send}` would make its bounds depend on themselves. Retries are
expressed through a smaller operation instead. Under the time monoids no bounds
are declared, since the grade already is the bound.

An operation is called with

```
perform OperationName argument
```

which returns a `result-type` value and advances the accumulated grade by the
operation's grade.

Operation calls are given meaning by handlers:

```
let h =
  handler
  | x -> return-case
  | OperationName p k -> operation-case
  | ...
```

The return case runs when the handled program returns a value `x`. An operation
case runs when the handled program calls the operation; `p` is the
argument/parameter and `k` the continuation, resumed with `continue k with
result`. Operations without a case are forwarded to the enclosing handler.

An operation case need not have exactly the grade of the operation: it
suffices that its grade is a sub-grade of the operation's grade composed with
that of the continuation. So `PrintModel : model ~> print # {Heat; Extrude;
Cool}` may be handled by performing `Heat`, `Extrude` and `Cool`
in that order and continuing, while another order is rejected:

    The case for `PrintModel` has grade `{Cool; Extrude; Heat}`, which does not
    match the grade `{Heat; Extrude; Cool}` of `PrintModel` followed by its
    continuation
      Note: the resource inequality
        `{Cool; Extrude; Heat} <= {Heat; Extrude; Cool}` does not hold

Under the time monoids the same rule lets a case delay longer than the
operation's grade under `time-lower-bound`, and shorter under
`time-upper-bound`.

The grade of the continuation `k` is not known when the handler is typechecked,
so an operation case must be well-typed for *every* grade `rho` of `k`. The
typechecker makes `rho` a rigid grade variable: unification never solves it, and
it may not occur in the type of a top-level definition, so it can be neither
fixed by the case nor instantiated at a use site. Inequalities mentioning `rho`
are still decided where the order allows. A case that does not resume, `Op p k
-> 5`, has grade `0`, a sub-grade of `1 + rho` for every `rho` under an upper
bound, where zero is the minimum, but for no `rho` under a lower bound, where
the messages state the quantification and the failing instance:

    For every grade `ρ₀` the continuation `k` may have, the case for `Op` must
    have a grade matching `1 + ρ₀`, but its grade `0` does not
      Note: the resource inequality `∀ρ₀. 0 >= ρ₀ + 1` does not hold: for
        `ρ₀ = 0` it becomes `0 >= 1`

Resuming twice under `Op # 1` fails likewise under an upper bound, since
`rho + rho <= 1 + rho` fails already for `rho = 2`; under a lower bound it is
accepted, as `rho >= 0` always holds.

### The context of an operation case

An operation case runs at a time the handler does not fix: the call may come
at any point of the handled computation, and the case must be well-typed for
every grade its continuation may have. So a case is checked not in the ambient
context but in its *eternal restriction* — of the variables bound outside the
case only those of eternal type survive, and the grades accumulated before it
are erased. Using a variable of non-eternal type inside a case is rejected
outright, whatever the grades are:

    Variable `f` has type `unit → int # ρ₀`, which is not eternal, so it
    cannot be used in the case for `Op`: the case runs at a time the handler
    does not fix

The case's own `p` and `k`, and everything bound inside it, are unaffected:
they obey the usual rule that a non-eternal variable may not be used once a
grade has elapsed. When the type is a type variable the obligation becomes a
qualifier of the definition's scheme, as above, so
`let h x = handler | y -> y | Op p k -> let r = continue k with () in x` gets
the type `{eternal α} α → (α # ρ₀ ⇒ α # ρ₁)`, usable at `int` and not at
`unit -> unit`.

A continuation is a box, and a box type is never eternal, so an inner case
cannot resume an outer handler's continuation: in nested handlers each case
resumes its own continuation, and the outer one is resumed after the inner
`handle` returns. The same restriction stops a rigid continuation grade
escaping into the type of a definition through a captured function.

Top-level definitions are exempt: they are closed, time-invariant values, so
they stay in scope inside a case whatever their type.

See [`tests/op_case_context.tpe`](tests/op_case_context.tpe) and the
`tests/op_case_context_reject_*.tpe` files, and
[`examples/handlers_lower_bound.tpe`](examples/handlers_lower_bound.tpe),
[`examples/handlers_upper_bound.tpe`](examples/handlers_upper_bound.tpe),
[`examples/handlers_nested.tpe`](examples/handlers_nested.tpe),
[`examples/handlers_nested_reject.tpe`](examples/handlers_nested_reject.tpe)
and [`examples/3dprint_handlers.tpe`](examples/3dprint_handlers.tpe).

### Default implementations

An operation may be given one default implementation, after its declaration:

```
default OperationName p = t
```

The default runs only when a call reaches the top level unhandled, that is,
after every enclosing handler has forwarded it; a handled call never uses it,
and a call without a default stops the run. The body `t` runs in place of the
call and its result goes to the continuation.

A default is checked against the operation's runtime bounds rather than its
grade: the body must have a sub-grade of `{lo}` under
`traces-lower-bound`, of `{hi}` under `traces-upper-bound`, and of
`({lo}, {hi})` under `traces-interval`. Under the time monoids it is
checked against the operation's grade. The grade itself cannot be required,
since realising `{Heat}` would mean performing `Heat` again. So

```
operation Heat : unit ~> unit # ({Heat}, {Heat}) within (1, 2)
default Heat () = delay 1
```

is accepted under `traces-interval` because `({1}, {1}) <= ({1}, {2})`,
while `delay 6` is rejected:

```
Comparing resource inequality ({6},{6}) <= ({1},{2}) failed
```

Under the trace monoids only *atomic* operations, graded by the single run of
themselves such as `Heat # {Heat}`, may have defaults; a compound operation
such as `PrintModel # {Heat; Extrude; Cool}` is meant to be handled in terms
of the operations it names. A default may itself perform operations, which are
handled or defaulted in turn; a default that performs its own operation
typechecks but never terminates.

## Sub-effecting and its limits

Currently, a grade may be replaced by a super-grade in the sub-grade order in
exactly three places: an operation case of a handler, a default implementation
of an algebraic operation, and a function annotation. Everywhere else the
prototype compares grades by unification, that is, for equality:

- the branches of a `match` or `if` currently must have the same grade;
- the grade of a box type is not coerced: a `[3]int` is not accepted where a
  `[2]int` is expected, regardless of the given resource monoid;
- function and handler types are compared for equality when a value is passed
  as an argument or a computation is handled, so a function of type
  `unit -> int # 1` is not accepted where `unit -> int # 2` is expected;
- a sub-effecting constraint is only checked once unification has made both of
  its grades ground. One that still mentions an unresolved grade parameter is
  rejected ("Cannot compare non-ground resource values"), except that `rho <= 0`
  with `rho` unknown is solved by `rho := 0` (the only solution when zero is the
  minimum of the order, and a sound but incomplete guess under
  `traces-interval`). A rigid continuation grade is never guessed at; an
  inequality mentioning one that the rules above leave open is rejected as
  non-ground. Inequalities are currently also not carried into the
  generalised types of top-level definitions.

The workaround, where a grade has to be increased, is an explicit type
annotation.
